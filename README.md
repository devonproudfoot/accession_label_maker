# Accession Label Creator by Devon Proudfoot
## A new and innovative label maker for all of your accessioning needs.  Updated periodically.


This program was created for Python3.  It may need to be edited to work with older versions of Python.  The Accession Labels program uses a combination of arguments and user input.  For more information, type txt_accession_labels. py --help

usage: 
`python3 txt_accession_labels.py {"donor name"} {donor number}`

The donor name must be enclosed in quotes if there are spaces or punctuation.  The script will then ask you for the date and types of extent in the accession.  The resulting labels will be found in the folder as {donor name}.txt
